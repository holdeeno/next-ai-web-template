# Marketing Website Template (AI-Enhanced)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project template designed for building marketing landing pages. It has been bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and enhanced with specific documentation and structures to facilitate collaboration with AI agents and AI-powered code editors.

**AI Agent Directive: IMPORTANT!**
Before making any modifications or additions to this project, please consult the AI-specific documentation located in the `/docs/ai/` directory. These documents provide crucial guidelines, architectural overviews, workflows, and component blueprints designed to ensure consistency, maintainability, and effective collaboration. Key documents include:
-   `docs/ai/AI_CODING_GUIDELINES.md`
-   `docs/ai/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
-   `docs/ai/EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md`
-   `docs/ai/AI_WORKFLOWS.md`
-   The `docs/ai/COMPONENT_BLUEPRINTS/` directory.

## Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (using App Router)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **UI Components (Planned):** [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (to be added in a subsequent step)
*   **TypeScript:** For type safety and improved developer experience.
*   **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Project Purpose

This template aims to provide a solid foundation for rapidly developing marketing websites and landing pages. It emphasizes:
1.  **AI Collaboration:** Extensive inline comments and dedicated markdown documentation are provided to guide AI agents in understanding the codebase, adhering to conventions, and performing common development tasks.
2.  **Modularity:** Encourages the use of reusable components.
3.  **Modern Best Practices:** Leverages the latest features of Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started (for Human Developers)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

4.  **Start editing:**
    You can begin by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## How to Use This Template for a New Landing Page

1.  **Understand the Structure:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure, especially the `app/` directory for pages/routes and the `components/` directory for UI elements.
2.  **Consult AI Documentation:** Review the `/docs/ai/` directory for guidelines on coding practices, architecture, and common workflows.
3.  **Build Components:** Create reusable React components for different sections of your landing page (e.g., Hero, Features, Testimonials, CTA) within the `components/` directory.
4.  **Assemble Pages:** Use these components to build out your pages in the `app/` directory.
5.  **Style with Tailwind CSS:** Utilize Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
6.  **Iterate and Deploy:** Follow the iterative deployment process (push to GitHub, deploy via Vercel) as you build out features.
