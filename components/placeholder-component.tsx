/**
 * @file placeholder-component.tsx
 * @description This is a placeholder component to illustrate the structure of the /components directory.
 * Real components for the landing page (e.g., HeroSection, FeatureCard) should be created here.
 *
 * AI Agent Instructions:
 * - When creating new UI components, place them in this `/components` directory.
 * - Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., PascalCase for component names, kebab-case for filenames if preferred, though PascalCase.tsx is also common).
 * - Ensure each component is self-contained or clearly imports its dependencies.
 * - Write detailed JSDoc comments for each component, explaining its purpose, props, and usage.
 * - Include specific AI instructions within comments if there are nuances to how an AI should interact with or modify the component.
 * - Refer to `docs/ai/AI_CODING_GUIDELINES.md` for more detailed component creation guidelines.
 * - Refer to `docs/ai/COMPONENT_BLUEPRINTS/` for templates for common landing page components.
